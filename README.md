<h2>About</h2>
Foods Explorer is a food delivery aplication builded - alongside with its own api (https://github.com/sagraziela/foods-explorer-server) - to help a restaurant to scale its demand by reaching clients at any place. This project was developed as the final challenge of the full-stack web development course (Explorer) offered by Rocketseat school.

<h2>Features</h2>
With the administrator's account, the restaurant's owner can register and edit the foods of its menu, manage the customer's orders, change the restaurant's data and create new administrator accounts for its employees.

The customer's account enables the user to search for the foods in the menu, save its favorite foods, make orders and keep up with it.

<h2>Layout</h2>
The application layout is available on Figma:
